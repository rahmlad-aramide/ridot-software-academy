        <p>The role of a program manager often straddles the line between tech and non-tech domains, making it a unique and somewhat ambiguous position. When newbies are contemplating which tech path to choose, some aren’t sure if being a program manager requires technological knowledge or not.</p>
        <p>Firstly, a program manager is a strategic project-management professional whose job is to help oversee and coordinate the various projects, products, and other strategic initiatives across an organization. <a href="https://www.productplan.com" class="text-blue-500 underline">Definition Source: www.productplan.com</a></p>
        <p>As a program manager, one must have superb communication skills (ability to interact with stakeholders), the ability to make decisions, be capable of allocating and managing resources efficiently, and have the ability to delegate tasks. A program manager must ensure that specialists have what they need and that their work aligns with the program’s goals. This requires oversight and coordination more than technical ability.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Technological Areas Applicable to Program Management</h2>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Essential Non-Tech Skills</h2>

All of these and more could be achieved while sitting with your technological devices.

        <p>Technology in Nigeria is steadily growing with advancements in various sectors such as fintech, e-commerce, and mobile technology. Initiatives like tech hubs, incubators, and government support programs have fostered a thriving startup ecosystem. Additionally, the increased availability of high-speed internet and the rise of mobile connectivity have contributed to the expansion of digital services across the country. Despite all hurdles in the realm of technology in Nigeria, the government still scales in all areas.</p>
        <p>However, the country is still faced with challenges that hinder the continuous progress of the state of technology. Challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, access to funding, and digital literacy gaps still exist. In addition, a lot of tech innovators in Nigeria who are willing to improve the country end up discouraged and even give up due to the unavailability of resources and amenities, especially electricity.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Brief History About Technology in Nigeria</h2>
        <p>Technology in Nigeria has evolved significantly over the years. In the early days, technological advancements were mainly driven by the oil and gas industry. However, the democratization of the internet in the late 20th century opened up new opportunities for innovation. In the 2000s, mobile telecommunications began to flourish with the widespread adoption of mobile phones and the emergence of mobile money services.</p>
        <p>The mid-2000s saw the establishment of tech hubs and incubators, such as co-creation Hub (CcHub) and iDEA Hub, which played a crucial role in nurturing startups and fostering innovation. In 2010, the Nigerian government launched the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to promote the development and regulation of information technology in the country.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Nigeria has witnessed a surge in tech startups, particularly in sectors like fintech, e-commerce, and agritech. Initiatives like the Nigerian Communications Commission’s (NCC) licensing of spectrum bands for broadband internet have helped improve internet access and connectivity nationwide.</p>
